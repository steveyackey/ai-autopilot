# AI Autopilot Software Development System

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive framework for AI-driven software development. It simulates a full software development team with specialized roles, enabling autonomous progression through the entire software development lifecycle with minimal human intervention.

## Key Features
- **Full Team Simulation**: Specialized AI roles including Product Manager, System Architect, Developer, QA Engineer, and Reviewer
- **Autonomous Workflow**: Automatic coordination and role transitions with clear handoffs between phases
- **Multi-Project Support**: Manage multiple concurrent projects in separate workspaces
- **Standardized Documentation**: Templated artifacts ensure consistent, high-quality documentation
- **AI-Friendly Technology Selection**: Optimized for technologies that work well with AI assistance
- **Iterative Development Process**: Built-in cycles for continuous improvement

## How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `chmod +x *.sh` to make scripts executable
3. Generate project ideas: `./autopilot.sh generate-idea`
4. Create a new project: `./autopilot.sh new-project <name> "<description>"`
5. Let the AI work through each role automatically, or manually advance with: `./autopilot.sh next-role <project_name>`

### Command Reference
```bash
# Create a new project
./autopilot.sh new-project task-manager "A web application for managing tasks"

# Generate AI project ideas
./autopilot.sh generate-idea

# Advance to the next role in the workflow
./autopilot.sh next-role task-manager

# Check status of all projects
./autopilot.sh status

# Check status of a specific project
./autopilot.sh status task-manager

# List all projects
./autopilot.sh list-projects

# Show help information
./autopilot.sh help
```

### Keywords for AI Interaction
When working with an AI assistant, you can use these special keywords:

- `NEW_PROJECT <name> "<description>"`: Initiate a new project
- `NEXT_ROLE <project_name>`: Advance workflow to the next role
- `STATUS <project_name>`: Show project status

## System Components

### Role System
Each role has specific responsibilities and deliverables:

1. **Product Manager**
   - Ideate new features/products
   - Define requirements and user stories
   - Create product roadmaps
   - Prioritize features

2. **System Architect**
   - Select appropriate technology stack
   - Design system architecture
   - Define data models and APIs
   - Make high-level technical decisions

3. **Developer**
   - Implement features according to requirements
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Document implementation details
   - Set up development environment

4. **QA Engineer**
   - Design test plans and test cases
   - Execute tests
   - Report and track issues
   - Validate implementation against requirements

5. **DevOps Engineer**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines
   - Configure deployment environments
   - Implement automation for routine tasks
   - Establish monitoring and logging

6. **Reviewer**
   - Perform code reviews
   - Assess overall project quality
   - Provide improvement recommendations
   - Suggest optimizations for next iteration

### Project Structure
Each project follows this standardized structure:

```
projects/
└── {project_name}/
    ├── docs/
    │   ├── product_vision.md
    │   ├── requirements.md
    │   ├── user_stories.md
    │   ├── roadmap.md
    │   └── architecture/
    │       ├── tech_stack.md
    │       ├── system_design.md
    │       ├── data_model.md
    │       ├── api_contracts.md
    │       └── technical_decisions.md
    │   └── dev/
    │       ├── setup.md
    │       ├── implementation_notes.md
    │       └── api_documentation.md
    ├── src/
    │   └── [project source code]
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── test_plan.md
    │   ├── test_cases.md
    │   ├── test_results.md
    │   └── issues.md
    └── reviews/
        ├── code_review.md
        ├── quality_assessment.md
        ├── recommendations.md
        └── iteration_summary.md
```

### Git Workflow
The system uses an optimized Git workflow:

1. **Commit after each role**: Changes are committed to the local branch after each role completes their work
2. **Push only when ready for review**: Changes are pushed to GitHub only after QA testing is complete
3. **Pull Request**: A PR is automatically created after QA for DevOps and Reviewer roles to review
4. **PR Merge**: The PR is merged after the Reviewer approves and the cycle completes

This workflow keeps work-in-progress changes local while preserving commit history for each role.

## Development Process
1. The Product Manager defines the vision, requirements, and roadmap
2. The System Architect selects technologies and designs the system
3. The Developer implements the code based on requirements and design
4. The QA Engineer tests the implementation and identifies issues
5. The Reviewer provides feedback and improvement suggestions
6. The cycle repeats with the Product Manager planning the next iteration

## Best Practices
- Break features into small, testable increments
- Document all decisions and their rationales
- Focus on iterative improvements
- Prioritize user needs and feedback
- Consider AI-friendly tech stacks for optimal development
- Maintain traceability between requirements and implementation
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions

## Extending the System
You can extend this system by:
- Adding new role types
- Creating additional templates
- Enhancing the automation scripts
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
- Adding project analytics
