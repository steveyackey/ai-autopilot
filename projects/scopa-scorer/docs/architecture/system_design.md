# System Design

## Overview
The system will be updated to include the following new features:

- User Feedback: A new "Feedback" page will be added to the frontend, allowing users to submit feedback. This feedback will be stored in a MongoDB database.
- Security Audit: A new security audit tool will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This tool will scan the codebase for vulnerabilities and generate a report.
- Code Review Process Improvements: A new code review checklist will be created and integrated into the code review process. Code review metrics will be tracked and displayed to administrators.

## Components
- Frontend:
    - Feedback Page: A new page for submitting user feedback.
    - Admin Dashboard: A dashboard for viewing aggregated user feedback and code review metrics.
- Backend:
    - Feedback API: An API for storing and retrieving user feedback.
    - Security Audit Tool: A tool for scanning the codebase for vulnerabilities.
    - Code Review Metrics Tracker: A tool for tracking code review metrics.
- Database:
    - MongoDB: A database for storing user feedback and code review metrics.
