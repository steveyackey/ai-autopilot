# Technical Decisions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
  - Provides strong typing and component reusability
  - Large ecosystem and community support
  - Excellent performance for interactive applications
  
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
  - Centralized state management for game scores and history
  - DevTools for debugging
  - Predictable state updates

- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI)
  - Ready-made responsive components
  - Customizable theming
  - Built-in accessibility features
  - Dark/light mode support

- **PWA Framework**: Vite PWA plugin
  - Service worker for offline functionality
  - Fast development and build times
  - Modern build tooling

### Storage
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB
  - Robust offline storage capability
  - Storage of game history and settings
  - Better performance than localStorage for larger datasets

- **State Persistence**: redux-persist
  - Automatic state saving
  - Configurable storage engines
  - Seamless state rehydration

### Internationalization
- **i18next**
  - Support for English and Italian
  - Dynamic language switching
  - JSON-based translations

## Architecture Decisions

### Application Structure
1. **Component Architecture**
   - Atomic design pattern
   - Reusable UI components
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **State Management**
   - Game state in Redux
   - UI state in component local state
   - Persistent storage sync

3. **Data Flow**
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - Action creators for game events
   - Reducers for score calculations

### Progressive Web App
1. **Offline First**
   - Service worker caching
   - IndexedDB for data persistence
   - Offline-first architecture

2. **Installation**
   - Web app manifest
   - Install prompts
   - Home screen icon

### Performance Considerations
1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based splitting
   - Lazy loading of non-critical components
   - Dynamic imports for rules/reference content

2. **Optimization**
   - Image optimization
   - Bundle size monitoring
   - Performance budgets

### Security
1. **Data Privacy**
   - Local-first storage
   - No external dependencies for core functionality
   - Optional cloud sync with consent

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Jest for logic
   - React Testing Library for components
   - Redux store testing

2. **E2E Tests**
   - Cypress for critical user paths
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile device testing

## Development Workflow
- Git-flow branching strategy
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Lighthouse scores tracking
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Optional anonymous usage analytics
