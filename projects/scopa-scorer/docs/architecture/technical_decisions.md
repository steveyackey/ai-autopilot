# Technical Decisions

## User Feedback
- Decision: Implement a new "Feedback" page in the frontend using React.
- Rationale: React is the existing frontend framework, and a new page can be easily integrated.
- Decision: Store user feedback in a MongoDB database.
- Rationale: MongoDB is the existing database, and it is well-suited for storing unstructured data like user feedback.
- Decision: Implement a new "Feedback API" in the backend using Node.js and Express.
- Rationale: Node.js and Express are the existing backend technologies, and a new API can be easily integrated.

## Security Audit
- Decision: Integrate a security audit tool into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Rationale: This will ensure that the codebase is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities on a regular basis.
- Decision: Use ESLint with security plugins for static code analysis.
- Rationale: ESLint is already used for linting, and security plugins can be easily added.

## Code Review Process Improvements
- Decision: Create a new code review checklist.
- Rationale: A checklist will ensure that all code reviews are thorough and consistent.
- Decision: Track code review metrics in a MongoDB database.
- Rationale: MongoDB is the existing database, and it is well-suited for storing structured data like code review metrics.
- Decision: Implement a new "Code Review Metrics API" in the backend using Node.js and Express.
- Rationale: Node.js and Express are the existing backend technologies, and a new API can be easily integrated.
