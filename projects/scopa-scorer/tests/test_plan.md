# Scopa Scorer Test Plan - Iteration 2

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing approach for iteration 2 of the Scopa Scorer application, focusing on the enhanced scoring interface, visual feedback, and game management features.

### 1.1 Scope

The testing will cover:
- Enhanced scoring interface with +/- controls
- Visual feedback for score changes
- Game management features (New Game, Reset Game)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Internationalization of new components

### 1.2 Test Objectives

- Verify that all new components function as expected
- Ensure animations and visual feedback work correctly
- Validate game state management through Redux
- Confirm accessibility features are properly implemented
- Test responsive design across device sizes
- Verify internationalization support for English and Italian

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Types of Testing

#### 2.1.1 Functional Testing
- Component testing for each new UI component
- Feature testing for game management and scoring
- Integration testing for component interactions
- End-to-end testing for complete user flows

#### 2.1.2 Non-functional Testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing of animations
- Responsive design testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### 2.2 Testing Environments

- Desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile browsers: Chrome (Android), Safari (iOS)
- Screen sizes: Mobile (320px-767px), Tablet (768px-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
- Operating systems: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS

## 3. Test Features

### 3.1 Enhanced Scoring Interface

- ScoreControl component functionality
- Increment/decrement buttons behavior
- Score animation and badges
- Min/max value constraints
- Tooltip functionality

### 3.2 Visual Feedback System

- ScoreChangeNotification component
- Toast notification appearance and dismissal
- Animation effects
- Different states (increase/decrease)

### 3.3 Game Management

- Game Controls component
- New Game functionality with dialog
- Reset Game functionality with dialog
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Confirmation systems for destructive actions

### 3.4 Form Validation

- Player name validation in NewGameForm
- Duplicate player name detection
- Required field validation
- Target score selection

### 3.5 State Management

- Redux store updates
- Score history tracking
- Undo functionality
- Game state persistence

## 4. Testing Approach

### 4.1 Unit Testing

- Test individual components in isolation
- Verify Redux reducers and actions
- Test utility functions

### 4.2 Integration Testing

- Test interactions between components
- Verify state flow through the application

### 4.3 System Testing

- End-to-end scenarios like starting a game, scoring, and ending rounds
- Game lifecycle management

### 4.4 Accessibility Testing

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast

### 4.5 Compatibility Testing

- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive design testing

## 5. Test Schedule

| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Test Planning | Create test plan and cases | 1 day |
| Test Execution | Execute test cases | 2 days |
| Defect Reporting | Report and document issues | 1 day |
| Verification | Verify fixes and final validation | 1 day |

## 6. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 6.1 Entry Criteria

- Code implementation is complete
- Development environment is available for testing
- Test cases are prepared

### 6.2 Exit Criteria

- All test cases have been executed
- No critical or high-severity defects remain
- All requirements have been verified
- Test results and issues are documented

## 7. Testing Tools

- React Testing Library for component testing
- Jest for unit testing
- Vitest for test runner
- Browser DevTools for debugging and performance analysis
- Lighthouse for accessibility testing
- Redux DevTools for state management testing

## 8. Risks and Contingencies

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Animation performance issues on mobile devices | Medium | Test on low-end devices, optimize animations |
| Keyboard navigation conflicts | Medium | Test thoroughly across all interactive elements |
| Inconsistent behavior across browsers | High | Cross-browser testing with focus on problematic areas |
| Redux state complexity | Medium | Thorough testing of state transitions and edge cases |

## 9. Reporting

Test results will be documented in:
- `test_results.md` - Summary of test execution
- `issues.md` - Detailed issue reports
- `test_coverage.md` - Analysis of test coverage
- `verification_report.md` - Final verification report
