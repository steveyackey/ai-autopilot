- Trivial: 0

## Issue Details

### 1. Animation Act Warnings in Tests

**ID:** SCOPA-001  
**Type:** Technical Debt  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Status:** Open  
**Found in:** Unit Tests  

**Description:**  
The RulesReference component tests are generating React warnings about missing act() wrappers around state updates. These warnings appear in the test output but don't affect the actual functionality of the application.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run the test suite with `npm run test`
2. Observe the warnings in the test output for RulesReference.test.tsx

**Expected Behavior:**  
Tests should run without warnings.

**Actual Behavior:**  
Tests pass but display warnings about missing act() wrappers:
```
Warning: An update to Transition inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).
When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):
act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
```

**Recommendation:**  
Update the tests to use proper act() wrappers around state updates, particularly for components with animations or transitions.

### 2. Component Test Coverage Gap

**ID:** SCOPA-002  
**Type:** Technical Debt  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Status:** Open  
**Found in:** Test Coverage  

**Description:**  
The new components added in iteration 2 (ScoreControl, ScoreChangeNotification, ConfirmationDialog, NewGameForm, GameControls) lack dedicated unit tests. This represents a gap in the test coverage that should be addressed to ensure long-term code quality.

**Impact:**  
While the components work correctly based on manual testing and integration with other components, lack of unit tests may lead to regression issues in future iterations.

**Recommendation:**  
Add comprehensive unit tests for each new component, covering:
1. Rendering of components with different props
2. User interactions (clicks, keyboard events)
3. State changes and animations
4. Edge cases (empty states, error states)

## Issue Tracking Status

| ID | Description | Severity | Status | Assigned To |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| SCOPA-001 | Animation Act Warnings in Tests | Minor | Open | *Unassigned* |
| SCOPA-002 | Component Test Coverage Gap | Minor | Open | *Unassigned* |

## Conclusion

No critical or major issues were identified during testing of Scopa Scorer iteration 2. The minor issues documented here relate to technical debt in the test suite rather than functional problems with the application. The application is considered stable and ready for review, while these issues can be addressed in future iterations to improve code quality and maintainability.
