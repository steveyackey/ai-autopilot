## Issues and Observations

### Minor Issues
1. Animation warnings in test suite (React warnings about acts) which don't affect functionality
2. Components tests could be expanded for better coverage

### Automated Test Results
All 18 automated tests are passing, including:
- RulesReference component tests (6)
- gameSlice reducer tests (12)

## Recommendations for Future Improvements
1. Add unit tests for new components (ScoreControl, ScoreChangeNotification, etc.)
2. Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress
3. Optimize animations for lower-end mobile devices
4. Add visual regression tests for UI components
5. Consider additional keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Conclusion

The Scopa Scorer application for iteration 2 has successfully passed all test cases. The enhanced scoring interface, visual feedback system, and game management features work as expected with good performance and accessibility. The application is ready for review and can proceed to the next phase.
