## DevOps Configuration

### Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated builds and deployment
- Multi-stage pipeline with build, test, and deploy steps
- Artifact generation and caching for faster builds
- Conditional deployment only from main branch

### Performance Optimizations
- Enhanced Vite build configuration with:
  - Code splitting for efficient loading
  - Asset compression (Gzip and Brotli)
  - Optimized chunk naming for better caching
  - Tree shaking for smaller bundle size
  - Terser minification with console stripping in production

### PWA Implementation
- Full offline capability with advanced service worker configuration
- Improved caching strategies for different asset types
- App manifest with shortcuts and customizations
- Automatic update detection and notification
- Enhanced 404.html for better SPA routing on GitHub Pages

### Security Measures
- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Modern security headers configuration
- Controlled caching directives for different asset types
- Input validation throughout the application

### Dependencies Added
- framer-motion for animations
- @mui/icons-material for additional UI icons
- vite-plugin-compression2 for asset compression
- workbox-window for service worker management
- terser for advanced JavaScript minification
