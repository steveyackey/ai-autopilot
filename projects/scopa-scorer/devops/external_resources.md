## Deployment
- GitHub Pages (Production hosting)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Docker Hub (Container registry)

## Infrastructure
- Docker containers for development and production
- NGINX for static file serving and routing
- Service Worker for offline functionality

## Domain Configuration

Production URL: `https://steveyackey.github.io/ai-autopilot/`

## External Services
- Google Fonts (CDN)
  - Cache policy: 1 year
  - CORS enabled
  - CSP configured

## Performance Optimizations

## Build & Deployment Process
1. GitHub Actions triggered on push/PR
2. TypeScript validation
3. Unit tests execution
4. Production build
5. Artifact generation
6. GitHub Pages deployment (main branch only)

## Development Setup
```bash
# Local development with hot reload
docker-compose up dev

# Production build and serve
docker-compose up app
```

## Health Monitoring
- Container health checks every 30s
- Automatic container restart on failure
- Build status monitoring via GitHub Actions

## Cache Configuration
