Take the following prompt and make the prompt better with 5 iterations before doing it. Then once done, iterate on the results 5x and make them even better. I want to optimize for speed, quality, and small changes fully tested.

I’ll be using a parent repo that I’ll use to ship multiple app ideas. I want AI to play all the roles of a software team/company. The instructions file should point to role specific files for things like feature brainstorming, evaluating next best feature, planning, coding, testing, reviewing, and any other key roles. All decisions and plans should be in markdown that’s well organized in folders. It should rotate to the next role in the order, and update its own instructions. I want it to our products in full auto pilot mode to build and ship and get feedback, and iterate. It should aim to optimize for AI friendly stacks, free tooling that runs well locally. The instructions should have a keyword to trigger the agent to create a whole new app ideation and creation phase in a new to level sub folder. It should pitch ideas and review them, and pick the best one. Also give the option to start from a use defined idea. Then it should use these same prompts. Create those roles/personas along with all the needed markdown to get started.
